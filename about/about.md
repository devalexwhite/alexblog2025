# About Me

I'm a tech guy located in Central Ohio in the United States. I've worked
in IT, software engineering, product design and currently work as a
engineering manager.

My true passion lies in building cool stuff with technology. I'm pretty
old school, and mostly work with tools most would call out of date
(plain PHP, HTML, JS, CSS). I feel pretty negatively about where the
internet (and tech as a whole is headed), especially LLMs. I find myself
using older tech in my daily life in an effort to stay away from silicon
valley crap (I rock an iPod, play PS2/Genesis/GBA frequently, purchase
physical media, etc).

Outside of tech, I'm a father of 2, an avid cyclist and
less avid swimmer. I spend the little free time I have riding, hiking,
playing with my kid or reading in a park.
