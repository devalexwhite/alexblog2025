---

The hardware and software I use on a daily basis. Last updated November 2025!

## Computing

### Surface Book 2

My daily driver laptop has recently changed from the MacBook Pro M1 to a 2017 Surface Book 2 (15" edition with dedicated GPU). 

- Ubuntu 25.10 (with Linux Surface Kernel and Gnome 3)
- Intel Core i7-8650U
- 16 GiB RAM
- 256 GiB SSD
- Nvidia GTX 1060 w/6GiB Memory

### MacBook Pro M1

My less commonly used backup laptop. While superior in performance to the Surface Book, I prefer the keyboard, display and Linux
experience on the Surface Book.

- macOS Tahoe + Fedora w/Asahi Linux
- 16 GiB RAM
- 256 GiB SSD
- M1 Pro

### NAS Synology Disk Station DS923+

- AMD Ryzen R1600
- 4 GiB RAM
- 2x4 TiB Western Digital NAS Drives

### Networking

- UniFi Dream Machine Pro Special Edition w/4 TiB Drive
- 3xU6 Lite Access Points
- AI Pro Camera
- G4 Instant Camera
- G5 Flex Camera

### Applications

- Vivaldi (testing this browser over Firefox)
- Gnome 3 (I LOVE the look and feel of Gnome + GTK applications)
- Gnome Terminal
- Sublime Text
- Sublime Merge
- DB Browser for SQLite
- Tuba (for Mastodon)
- Newsflash (for RSS)
- Folio (Markdown notes app)
- Apostrophe (Distraction free Markdown writer)
- Shortwave (awesome internet radio app)
- Blanket (ambient noise)
- Amberol (AMAZING app for streaming music off my NAS)

## Mobile

### iPhone 14 Pro Max

I switched back to my iPhone after using the Pixel 9 Pro for about a year. I picked up running and swimming in addition to cycling,
and the fitness tracking via my old Apple Watch is leagues better than the Pixel Watch.

- Apple Watch Series 5

### Google Pixel 9 Pro

Not a bad phone by any means, camera is awesome. Don't love how Gemini is shoved into everything though (even the freaking weather app has an AI summary).

- Google Pixel Watch 3

## Gaming

This is a long list, I frequently switch between retro consoles to play games with my son. Here's every console I have. Each retro console is original from my childhood (some were purchased at garage sales when I was a kid).

- NES
- SNES
- N64
- Wii U (soft modded)
- Switch
- Switch 2
- PS1 (soft modded with Tonyhax)
- PS2 (Japanese edition with a 2 TiB HDD)
- PS3 Super Slim (my old PS3 fat died due to CPU overheating)
- PS4 (in storage, never used anymore)
- PS5
- Sega Genesis (probably the console we play the most)
- Sega Dreamcast
- Xbox 360
- Xbox One
- Xbox Series X (probably the least used console, big mistake buying this guy)
- Gameboy Advance SP (modded, new LCD + case + backlighting + speaker + USB C charging)
- Nintendo DS
- Nintendo DSi
