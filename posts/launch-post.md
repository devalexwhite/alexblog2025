I go through personal websites like it's nobody's business, but I am
very help with the tech powering this latest iteration! I stumbled upon
11ty after reading another blog (if I ever remember which one, I'll add
a link here). After playing with it, I can safely say it's exactly what
a static site generator should be. Simple, to the point and a breeze to
setup. For now, I paired it with [Simple.css](simplecss.org) and was
able to get this blog up and running in 30 minutes (**editors note** the
blog now has a custom stylesheet)! Over time I'll build out my own
styles, but for now, this works!

As an added bonus, I __finally__ have an RSS feed! I follow so many
people via RSS it's wild that my own site didn't have it.
