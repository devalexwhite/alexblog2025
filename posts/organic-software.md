With the inevitable future of software being mass manufactured by overworked developers yelling at Claude to meet increasingly unrealistic deadlines ("you should be able to develop at 10X speed because of AI!"), I think we need an alternative. Let the masses consume slop software, but for those that care, there should be an "organic" option. Ethically sourced, high quality, priced at a premium.

Organic software would represent the hardwork of software craftspeople, aka those that give a shit. Software that is free from data collection, LLM slop and enshiftication. Instead, it would be created with optimized, well tested code and features driven by the best interests of users. Software that is a [delight to use](https://thatalexguy.dev/posts/software-that-delights-you/).

Where would this software be found? You wouldn't expect to find locally sourced vegetables and premium cuts of meat at the chain grocery store, rather you would look towards the local, multi-generational family owned grocery store. Similiarly, I predict discovery of well crafted software will become harder and harder on mobile and desktop app stores run by Microsoft, Apple and Google. As the priorities and ethics of these companies stray further and further from the craftspeople building great applications, those craftspeople will look for new platforms to develop on.

My hope is that Linux becomes the family grocery store. You go in expecting to find highly quality, well made software and you accept that you'll have to pay a premium for it. As it is now, Linux users tend to expect things to be free as in freedom ✱and✱ beer. I hope this mindset can slowly change, and breed a platform filled with tools like Nova, Transmit, iaWriter, OmniFocus, CodeKit, Bike Outliner, BBEdit, TablePlus, etc. Tools built by small teams of passionate people (or even solo developers), offered at premium prices that support development.

Honestly, I feel the mindset has to change. If it doesn't, I'm not very confident for the future of computing. Making a leather bag by hand takes time, experience and high quality materials. One expects to pay for that time and skill. On the other hand, if quality doesn't matter to someone, they can grab a pleather bag made in a factory for pennies on the dollar. If everyone goes for the pleather bag, there's no incentive for the leather craftsperson, and soon enough it will become a lost art. If the perception comes to pass that people will only use free, data harvesting, online only, LLM built software, the desktop is in peril.
