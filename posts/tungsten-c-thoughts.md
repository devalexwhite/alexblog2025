Mail day and an early birthday present to myself! My new-to-me Tungsten C arrived today, and let me say, it is an absolute joy to use!

The C has a smaller screen than my T3, WiFi instead of Bluetooth and is a bit heavier. The build quality is solid, par for the course when it comes to Tungsten devices. The CPU is similar to the T3, but seems noticeably faster (especially in Acid Freecell).

Without a doubt, the keyboard is the killer feature. I had forgotten how much I prefer a chicklet, physical keyboard to poking at a touchscreen. It's fast, easy to hit keys, and has a great clicky feeling to it. 

On the Wi-Fi front, I have yet to successfully connect to a network. My guess is my UniFi APs and Pixel Phone Hotspot use newer bands than the C supports. I might have an older router somewhere to give a shot later on. 

All in all, this is a great little device that will replace my T3 as my pocket carry. The keyboard just makes it such a productivity beast, even when compared to a modern cell phone! 

This post was, of course, written on my Tungsten C.

**Update on Wi-Fi**

Seems my Wi-Fi chip might be shot. Trying to do a system update errors saying that the radio ROM is corrupt. I have a new battery coming in the mail, so I'll see if there's anything obvious that needs soldering while I'm in there.
