I'm writing this in response to Kev Quirk's article of the same title,
which can be found [here on his
blog](https://kevquirk.com/blog/what-happens-after-we-die/).

This is a interesting topic for me, one that I'm not sure I'll be able
to do justice with my writing, but hey let's give it a shot.

I was raised in an atheist family, so to me there never has been an
alternative to the idea of "nothing" (as Kev mentioned) happening after
death. Just like I didn't exist before I was born, I'll simply not exist
after I pass. To me, it evokes the same feeling as thinking about space,
and what occurs outside of the observable universe. It's impossible for
me to imagine just pure, infinite nothingness. But that's just it, and
to be honest, it is a terrifying thing.

There'll be moments, maybe once or twice a year, were I feel an
existential dread as the thought crosses my mind. After life, is
just...nothing. The feeling typically passes in a few moments, but it's
a reminder of the space the thought occupies in my head.

As I got older, I started to dive into Buddhism a little bit. Not too
seriously, but enough to pick up some concepts from various books. In
Buddhism, there is the concept of Maraṇasati, or mindfulness of death.
In short, embracing and being present in the now, knowing that death can
come at any moment. At first it seems a negative notion, one could
interpret it as being constantly afraid of death. But really, it's
acknowledging that yes, death awaits, and that's even more reason to not
waste the present. Be more mindful, life is impermanent and that's okay.

Buddhism also teaches of the interdependence of all things. This ties
directly into Kev's statement that the elements that we are made of will
go on to to be recycled, and eventually make other life. Birth and death
are not the end, they are simply milestones on the journey the elements
that compose you are taking. Noah Rasheta did an excellent podcast
episode on this topic, which you can [find
here](https://secularbuddhism.com/podcast/what-happens-when-we-die/).

I probably should have more in depth thoughts on this subject,
especially as my mother is a philosophy professor that teaches a class
specifically on death and dying, but to be honest I still try to avoid
thinking about death. I've experienced a fair amount of it, my
grandfather when I was a teenager, my father in 2017, and my grandmother
a few days after my father. While it is comforting to think of the
concepts I detailed above, it doesn't (and shouldn't) fully ease the
pain of loss, or remove the fear of death. These concepts simply help
you understand and guide your emotions, and live a better now.

Anyways, thanks to Kev for posting an excellent article that got me thinking
this morning!
