A number of blogs I follow on RSS have posted this, so I figured why
not! The challenge was started by
[David](https://forkingmad.blog/ten-pointless-facts-about-me/).

## Do you floss your teeth?

Yes! Until I run out of the floss picks, which is right now. I feel bad
about how wasteful floss picks are, but without them I never floss.

## Tea, coffee, or water?

Coffee, and way too much of it. Probably ~3 cups a day. I've tried to
cut back by switching to tea after my first cup...but I'm not great at
following this.

## Footwear preference?

Recently got a pair of running shoes with the desire to start running
since it was getting too cold for cycling. Well, that didn't work out,
but they are incredibly comfortable for walking! At home I switch to
slippers (asian household).

## Favourite dessert?

Hmm, probably anything with cherries. Love a cherry pie, or cherry fry
pie!

## The first thing you do when you wake up?

Waking up falls into one of two categories:

1) My 3 year old barged into the bedroom and wants to play Tetris

2) I have a 5am group ride, so I've gotta throw on my kit and get out the
door

## Age you’d like to stick at?

Honestly, college was great, I'd love to go back to a time before a 9-5,
so maybe 21? Second choice would be right now, pretty happy with my
family and our life.

## How many hats do you own?

Maybe 4-5 baseball caps that I'll wear when my hair gets too long and I
don't want to dig out the dog clippers for a haircut. Then there's a
countless number of winter beanies. I guess helmets count as well, so
two of those.

## Describe the last photo you took?

A picture of a bike wheel with a circuit board on it that makes light
patterns as you ride. Someone in my group ride last night was showing it
off.

## Worst TV show?

There was some superhero show on Netflix with a big group of young
adults. I don't remember the title or anything else about it, but it was
awful.

## As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood?

I started coding when I was 12, so I pretty much always wanted to be in
tech (I mean, beyond the fireman/astronaut phase). I think I also really
wanted to run my own software business. Unfortunately never made that a
reality.
