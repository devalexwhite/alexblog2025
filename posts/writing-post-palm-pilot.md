When I was a kid, I was obsessed with Palm Pilot devices.. Computers that you can carry in your pocket, I mean how cool is that! My parents got me a m105, and later on a Tungsten E2. I took those devices everywhere! On long car trips, you'd find me in the back of the car playing The Quest or Kyle's Quest. When I was done gaming, I'd fold out my IR keyboard and start programming in C on a fully on-device IDE. I remember writing a stock market "simulation" game on a trip to Virginia, and making my first couple of dollars selling software on PalmDB.

Then smartphones came, and my Palm went into storage to be replaced by a first generation iPhone. The funny thing about the iPhone though, it never fully replaced the functionality of the Palm Pilot. Sure, it had a beautiful screen that you could touch with a finger (as opposed to a stylus), a camera, WiFi and calling, but it was (and still is) a lesser experience in some ways than the Palm. 

The built-in PIM apps on Palm (Contacts, Calendar, Tasks) are still some of my favorites for productivity. Simple, to the point, predictable in user interface. Similarly, the launcher ("Applications") is fast, easy to use and offers just enough customization. 

The real magic on Palm though comes from third-party applications. The Palm Pilot is from an era where boutique software developers crafted applications to provide value, rather than stick you with another subscription fee. Shareware on the Palm was a pay once ordeal, and for that you typically got exactly what you expected. No ads, tracking, internet requirement or bloat. Heck, the device I'm writing this on doesn't have WiFi and only comes with 64mb of onboard stoprage. Despite this limitations of these little devices, you had full word processors, spreadsheet and slideshow software, video/music players....and ENTIRE ONBOARD IDEs (integrated development environment). 

I can't understate how big having IDEs on device are, you can go from 0 to compiled application entirely on a Palm. There are applications to write code, build user interfaces, create icons and compile into binary. iOS definitely can't do this, and I'm fairly certain Android can't either. I honestly don't know if I would have gotten so into programming if not for my Palm Pilot as a kid. I never got to write Palm apps on a computer as we were a Apple family and the Palm development suite was Windows only, but with the power of an infrared keyboard and long car trips, I cranked out games and software.

All that backstory brings us to today. Here I am, sitting in a coffee shop listening to my iPod and typing on a keyboard with a little arm beaming keycodes into a Palm Tungsten T3. The keyboard is the same one that went on car trips with me 20 some years ago. One of the advantages of tech becoming retro is I can now afford the devices I drooled over in Staples all those years ago, hence the Tungsten T3 (and the Tungsten C on it's way to me via USPS). My Tungsten E2 still works and sits at home, although the bottom 10 rows of pixels are dead.

Here's the thing, this Palm feels great to use even today. It's fast and task oriented. There's no distractions and things just work. Sure I had to solder back on a battery terminal for the keyboard, but that's not bad for 20 years in storage. I plan to spend some time getting my dev environment set up again. When my new TC arrives, I'll be using that as a daily calendar, notes, expense tracking and tasks device (extremely excited about the builtin keyboard). The T3 will remain my gaming, development and writing device thanks to the amazing sliding screen.

I read an article months ago that, until recently, imax still used Palm Pilots to run their projectors. You give these little devices a task, and they do it, even for decades. You can't say that of newer tech. Updates will break compatibility, apps will be bought out by shady companies that sunset them or stuff them with ads, hardware fails that can't be repaired,. etc. A Palm Pilot on the other hand is always one HotSync away from what you need it to do.

Now that you've listened to me ramble about my love of these little devices, you might ask yourself "that's cool, but kinda silly, why should I care?". Well reader, here's a few quick hitters on why purchasing a $30 Palm Pilot could be a good idea in 2025(6):

- Focused writing device that [doesn't cost $600+](https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-smart-typewriter-3rd-gen)
- Great selection of classic games (one of the best solitaire games I've played on any device)
- Offline life organizer for tasks, contacts and calendars
- Focused document reader (again that doesn't [cost hundreds of dollars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DWRBVDN6?ref=stf_erd_s_kc_escen_mh11))
- Control TVs or stereos with the IR blaster
- Offline music player (although I DO prefer an iPod with Rockbox for this)
- Voice memos (this is a seriously awesome feature, my T3 has a dedicated button that you hold down to instantly record a memo. I don't think there's a faster way to record thoughts these days. You could even HotSync them, then run some speech to text analysis.....maybe a future article?).

Palm Pilots are another entry in the "forgotten, but not useless" tech category. If you do find yourself going down the Palm rabbit hole, I highly recommend the articles from [kelbot](https://fosstodon.org/@kelbot@retro.social) (you'll need a Gemini browser to view, [see my post on Gemini](https://thatalexguy.dev/posts/small-web-discovery) for recommendations) Have a favorite Palm OS application or memory you want to share? Send me an email and let's geek out over Palm Pilots!
