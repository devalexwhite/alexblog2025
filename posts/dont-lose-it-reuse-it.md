I read [an article](https://archive.ph/11cZP) a couple of days ago that in part blamed economic slowdown on people hanging onto their devices instead of buying the shiny new version like they used to. This article pissed me off so much I still can't stop thinking about it. It's the definition of everything wrong with capitalism, and a big part of what's destroying our environment. We should be celebrating people hanging on to devices for longer, which in turn leads to less waste, less need for manufacturing and supply chain. But instead, we blame. Ridiculous.

I was going to let this article go (except for a mumble I posted), but then I ran across [this page from Shopify](https://bfcm.shopify.com/) and my rage reignited. While I'll give the devs a huge kudos on how freaking cool the page is (the pinball, the racing mini game on the computer, awesome stuff), the focus on the insane display of consumerism is disgusting. So many people buying so much shit they don't need every single second. What the fuck. Think of how much of that crap will end up in the landfill. How much pollution is caused by the supply chain needed to fulfill those orders.

So here I am, writing a blog post. But fret not, I don't intent to be outraged this whole post. Instead, I want to use this post as a launching pad for a new series (maybe a new website even?). I want to inspire and inform people on how they can breathe new life into old technology.

At Thanksgiving this year, an elderly family member was describing how they planned to throw away their laptop and buy a new one. They were frustrated that browsing the internet on their old laptop had gotten slower as time marched on. I bet you can guess what happened next...I told them I'll get it running faster than new next time they visit. It'll run the internet just the same, work basically the same, but instead be running Zorin OS instead of Windows.

I'd love for there to be a resource that inspires others to go the same route. Tutorials on how to best transition a non-tech savvy computer user to Linux. How to debloat an Android phone instead of buying the newest iPhone 500 Pro Max X+ Gold Edition. Resurrection guides for old game systems so you can enjoy the millions of retro games instead of buying new $80 games. Step-by-step instructions on ditching streaming for an iPod with Rockbox, or recommendations on stereo systems you can find at Goodwill. Inspiration articles on how to self-host services rather than subscribe to SaaS products. Ideas and guides for being productive with a Palm Pilot.

Heck, maybe this could materialize as a physical print magazine with monthly tips. Or an IRC channel. Or a phpBB forum. I'm not 100% sure what this will look like, but I'd love for people to [email me](mailto:hi@thatalexguy.dev) with suggestions for format, content, etc.

Consumerism and big tech have run their course, and the endgame ain't pretty, but there are other options. You don't need the newest phone, laptop, software or games. You can own your data and media, repair your own hardware and even write your own  scripts. I think people just need an invitation to do so, and a guiding hand.
