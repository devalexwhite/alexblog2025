I want to build Ryder ([my cycling statistics
app](https://thatalexguy.dev/posts/ryder-project/)) in public as a way
to keep me motivated, so let's get into it!

## Changes

- Cleaner sidebar for ride statistics (side note, SF Symbols are
amazing)
- Speed graph
- Cadence parsing (I guess my cadence meter wasn't connected for the test file I was using)

## Coming up

- Data smoothing to fix jumps in speed and elevation graphs 
- Identification of notable segments (ie, climbs, descents)
- Identification of stops (stop lights/signs/cafe breaks)

## Further in the future

- Ride comparison (overlay multiple GPX files to compare rides/riders)
- Power meter support (I don't have one, so if you have a GPX file with
power data please send it my way!)
- File management
- Color coded route to correlate with speed/power
