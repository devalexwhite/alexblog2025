A family member was nice enough to get me a Commodore VIC-20 for Christmas! I grew up writing BASIC on an Atari 400 (despite being born 12 years after the release), but have always want to get my hands on a Commodore. The system needs a bit of work before I can use it though. First thing is a power supply, which shockingly seem to be $80+. I also need a video cable, but I **think** my Sega Genesis one will work (it fits at least). The "0" key is missing on the keyboard, so I think I'll need a new stem and keycap. I should probably buy a recap kit as well. Finally, I'll need something to load up software. Kung-Fu Flash or SD2IEC seem like good choices.

Eventually I'd also like to get it online and connect to a BBS, but one step at a time! I'd love to find a way to write a blog post from it as well!

For the Commodore enthuaists out there, let me know any hardware/software suggestions or thoughts on what I can do once I get the system up and running!
