Okay, this one is going to reek of old man yelling at the clouds, but ya know what? That's kinda where I am in life.

The past couple of times I've been at the gym, something has really bugged me. People occupying machines, doing either nothing or the bare minimum. Instead of focusing on improving their physical fitness (ya know, the point of a gym), they scroll tiktok. They'll be sitting at the weight machine, walking on the lowest speed on the treadmill or even standing in the pool holding their phone. It's insane to me!

Of course this isn't limited to the gym. Every time I stop at a traffic light and look around, 3 out of 5 people have their heads down, catching up on social media, occasionally glancing up to see if they are supposed to be doing something seemingly less important (like driving a death machine on wheels). 

It makes me wonder if civil engineers take into account distracted drivers when designing an intersection. I've seen lights that are so short, nobody has gotten to move because the lead car was on their phone and missed the whole light. I've sat behind cars going 15 under the speed limit, bouncing off the curb as the person's head is down the whole time. I think you have to assume driving is a second or third priority for people behind the wheel. 

You go to a park, every parent is on their phone while kids beg "please play with me". The parents are effectively signaling to their kids "this short form video is more important than whatever you're doing". And when those kids grow up, they'll have learned that behavior as the norm.

It's just frustrating. How is it so hard to leave your damn phone in the locker, glove box or at home? 

Also get off the damn bench press, I need to use it.

Go ahead and get off my lawn while you're at it.
