title: Year of Calmness
---
There was a thread recently on [tildes.net](https://tildes.net/~talk/1rtm/how_do_you_want_to_define_2026_for_yourself#comment-gzll) about New Year resolutions. In one comment the poster mentioned how they choose a new "name" each year the represents what they want to embody.

The idea of picking a new name for yourself stuck with me.. Instead of prescribing to set goals and feeling deflated when you miss them, you define what you want to become and figure out what that means throughout the year.

For me, I immediately thought of "Calmness". I've always been an anxious, relatively negative person. I live a somewhat hectic life between 2 kids, 2 dogs, 3 kids, working at a startup, doing freelance work and managing 2 rental properties. I almost always have a physical feeling of anxiety in my chest, something that used to be regulated to the night before tests in college has become a constant companion.  

This year, I want to embody calmness, regardless of the situation.

I don't know exactly what this looks like, and that's kind of the idea. I want to make decisions and react based on what it means to be calm, rather than dictate meaning beforehand. 

In pursuit of discovering what calmness means to me, I plan to get back into researching non-secular Buddhism and meditation. Before my son was born, I really dug into Buddhism and enjoyed what I learned, but after the birth that faded away. There was also an incident of joining a local sect that turned out to be internationally recognized as a cult, but hey shit happens!

Another aspect I've been thinking a lot about is my tendency to see things in absolutes. A big example of this has been AI/LLMs. I've been nothing but critical and vocally anti AI, to the point I quickly dismiss any ability to see a positive side. This week I returned to work and (much as I expected) AI has integrated itself into every workflow. Following my new mindset has allowed me to see there are true benefits, even if that is a renewed interest in technology from my teammates. Whereas previously I would have dismissed and moaned, I'm now listening and learning. 

Now don't worry, this site will still remain LLM free, but maybe I'll stop complaining about the technology so much. Maybe.

The final supporting piece I've discovered (so far) for my new mindset has been daily journaling. I've tried to pickup journaling before, but was always too serious and prescriptive about it. This time, with the help of the excellent DayNotez program on Palm OS, I've been writing multiple times a day. These have been short entries that help me process events or get my thoughts onto "paper". There is a lot to be said about writing your thoughts and seeing them laid out in-front of you. It sparks new ideas and frees space in your mind.

Realizing that we are only 6 days into the new year, I admit things will change and I may even forget this whole adventure. But so far, embodying the "name" of Calmness has helped me navigate a number of things (including a crisis with one of our rental properties). I hope I can look back in a year with a deep understanding of how to approach situations with calmness.

I'd love to hear what resolutions or goals others have for 2026, maybe we can help keep each other accountable! Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:hi@thatalexguy.dev).

Stay calm and carry on!
