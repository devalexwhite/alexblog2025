Recently I [wrote about my frustrations](https://thatalexguy.dev/posts/dont-lose-it-reuse-it/) with big tech. I was (and still am) angry with the continued erosion of privacy, the push to buy instead of repair and the loss of tech/software/media ownership. In that article, I promised to do **something**. I wasn't sure what it would look like, and to be honest, I'm still not positive, but today I'm starting _somewhere_.

We Own Our Tech is an online publication that will be focused on advocating for tech ownership through guides, articles and educational materials that cover topics such as: repairability, self-hosting, open-source alternatives, revitalizing vintage technology and moving off of big tech platforms. 

My goal is to provide inspiration and resources so that others can discover a different outlook on technology have a starting point to take back the technology in their life.

I hope to grow this into a community of more than just myself. In addition to the website, I see building out an online forum and hosting in-person events. I've also considered the idea of spinning up a non-profit. But for right now, I'm focusing on finding the voice and writing style that works best. The level of detail people are interested in, and the content that best serves We Own Our Tech's goals.

All that said, We Own Our Tech's first article went live today. It's a piece on why one should consider vintage compact digital cameras over smartphones cameras. You can read the article at We Own Our Tech here: [https://weownourtech.org/](https://weownourtech.org/leave-the-phone-take-a-camera/).

I want to keep this project separate from my personal blog, which might be a struggle at first (as tech ownership is a huge passion of mine, and what I often write about), but I'll figure it out over time. Please bear with me!

For those of you subscribed to my RSS, you might be interested in [We Own Our Tech's feed](https://weownourtech.org/rss) as well. 

Finally, thanks to everyone that reached out regarding this project. The enthusiasm I received has helped me get something off the ground. Please continue to reach out and let me know what you don't like so I can iterate and improve. 

I'm building this because I feel like we are at a critical tipping point in the tech space. Rampant enshittification along with the continued stripping of privacy, right-to-repair and ownership rights has rapidly degraded a space I've been in love with since I was a child. While one little movement will never have a louder voice than the billions of marketing dollars big-tech has, I hope it can help at least a small number of people fall in love with technology again.
