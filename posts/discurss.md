Silly project time!

What if you could have an entire discussion thread entirely within RSS? Well now you can with [DiscuRSS](https://thatalexguy.dev/discurss/index.php)!

Here's how it works, every so often I post a new topic to kick off the discussion. This action generates a blank RSS feed with the topic as the first entry. Visitors can then join the conversation, with each comment being added to the RSS feed. Is it silly? Definitely. But it might be fun!

Subscribe to the [DiscuRSS RSS Feed](https://thatalexguy.dev/discurss/rss.xml) to follow the discussion. Add your thoughts to the thread with [this form](https://thatalexguy.dev/discurss/index.php).
