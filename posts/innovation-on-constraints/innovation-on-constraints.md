I've mentioned a few times on my blog about daily driving a Palm Pilot. I've been using either my Tungsten C or T3 for the past 2 months. These devices have taken the place of my smartphone in my pocket. They hold my agenda, tasks, blog post drafts, databases of my media collection and child's sleep schedule and lots more. Massive amounts of data, in kilobytes of size. Simply put, it's been a joy to use these machines, more so than my smartphone ever has been.

I've been thinking about the why behind my love of Palm Pilots. Is it simply nostalgia for my childhood? Or maybe an overpowering disdain for modern tech? Yes to both of these, but it's also something more. I genuinely believe the software on Palm is BETTER than most of what you'll find on Android or iOS.

The operating system itself, the database software ([HanDBase](https://palmdb.net/app/handbase)) I use to track my child's bed times, the outline tool I plan projects with ([ShadowPlan](https://palmdb.net/app/shadowplan)), the program I'm writing this post on ([CardTXT](https://palmdb.net/app/cardtxt)) and the solitaire game I kill time with ([Acid FreeCell](https://palmdb.net/app/acid-freecell)), they all feel special. Each app does an absolutely excellent job, only takes up kilobytes of storage, opens instantly, doesn't require internet or a subscription fee (everything was pay once). But I think there's an additional, underpinning reason these pieces of software are so great: constraint.

The device I'm using right now, the Palm Pilot Tungsten T3, has a 400MHz processor, 64MiB of RAM and a 480x320 pixel screen. That's all you have to work with! You can't count on network connectivity (this device doesn't have WiFi). You have to hyper optimize for file size and performance. Each pixel needs to serve a purpose  (there's only 153,600 of them!).

When you're hands are tied behind your back, you get creative and focused. Constraint truly is the breeder of innovation, and something we've lost. A modern smartphone is immensely powerful, constantly online, capable of multitasking and has a high resolution screen. Building a smartphone app means anything goes. Optimizations aren't as necessary, space isn't a concern, screen real estate is abundant. 

Now don't get me wrong, there's definitely a balance of too much performance and too little. There's a reason I'm not writing this on a Apple Newton (well, the cost of buying one). But on the other hand, look at the Panic Playdate. It has a 168MHz processor, 16 MiB RAM and a 400x240 1-bit black & white screen, yet there are some [beautiful](https://play.date/games/diora/), [innovative](https://play.date/games/reel-istic-fishing/) games hitting the console. Developers have to optimize every line of C code for performance, and keep an eye on file size, just like the Palm Pilot. 

I've experienced the power of constraint myself as a developer. My most successful projects have been ones where I limited myself from using libraries, and instead focused on plain PHP + MySQL. With a framework project and composer behind you, you implement every feature that crosses your mind, heck it's just one "composer require" away! But when you have to dedicate real time to writing each feature, you tend to hyper focus on what adds value to your software.

I think this is what powers great Palm software. You don't have the performance or memory to add bloat. You don't have the screen real estate to build some complicated, fancy UI. You don't have the network connectivity to rely on offloading to a server. You need to make a program that launches instantly, does it's job well enough to sell licenses and works great even in black & white. That's a tall order, and a lot of developers knocked it out of the park.

All this has got me thinking about what a modern, constrained PDA would look like. Something akin to the Playdate, but for the productivity side of the house. Imagine a Palm Pilot with a keyboard, USB C, the T3 screen size, maybe a color e-ink display, expandable storage, headphone jack, Bluetooth (for file transfer), infrared (I REALLY like IR) and a microphone (for voice memos). Add an OS similar to Palm OS 5, or a slightly improved version of it. Keep the CPU, memory, RAM all constrained (within reason). 

That would be a sweet device, and I'd love to see what people would do with it.

I plan to start doing reviews on some of my favorite Palm Pilot software, especially the tools that help me plan and write this blog, so be on the lookout!
