Another great entry in the Wayfarer series! This book shifted the focused to a sentient AI that finds itself in a android-like body kit.
The character development here was amazing, and there were some tear-up moments for me. It was nice have a shift from the spacer environment
to planetside, and I especially loved the Pepper side-story. Forward onto the next entry in the series!
