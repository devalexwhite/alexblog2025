I'll be honest, I barely made it 60 pages into this book, it was not at
all what I had expected. The idea sounded awesome, a fantasy novel from
the bad guy's perspective (well, the accomplice to the bad guy). I was
expecting questions of morality, henchmen management, secret evil
treasures, elaborate traps, etc. What I got a light humor mixed with a
ton of romance. Not my kind of book at all. Then I learned the author
was a promiment tik tokker (how every you write that) and it made sense
why it wasn't for me.
