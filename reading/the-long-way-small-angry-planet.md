This was an __excellent__ read, and Becky Chambers as quickly become one of my favorite Science Fiction authors! I've heard
this book described as "cozy fiction", and that absolutely applies. Sure, there's conflict, but it's nice knowing that it
will have a happy ending. The character development was top-notch and the setting was enjoyable. There's a good amount of
world-building as well. I was very happy to learn this is 1 of 4 books in the Wayfarer series, and will be quickly moving
on to the next book!
