# Welcome Traveller

You awaken, finding yourself in a small clearing under a canopy of
sequoia trees. In the distance, you hear the rustle of branches as
squirrels dart across branches. To the **East**, the faint sound of a stream
weaving through the trees. Ahead, to the **North** a building is faintly
visible through the leaves.

What do you do?
