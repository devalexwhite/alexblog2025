As you climb the step to the patio, you hear movement inside the cabin.
Seconds later, the door opens, revealing a tall man smiling at you,
holding a cup of coffee with a book under his arm.

> Well hello there, welcome to my blog! Hope you had a pleasant journey,
> don't get many visitors around these parts, but always happy to meet
> those that make the trip. I've got some fresh RSS feeds cooking if
> you're interested. I'll let you wonder around, it was great meeting
> you!

The man walks over to a rocking chair and takes a seat. He opens up the
book and takes a sip from his coffee. A few moments later he looks back at you.

> Forgot to mention, this "adventure" is still a work in progress, so check
> back now and again to see what's changed.

He goes back to his book, taking another sip of coffee.
