You follow along the stream, watching fish dart below the surface. At one point you see
a crane, standing on a rock in the middle of the water. He watches briefly as you walk past, quickly
returning his gaze to the potential snacks under the water.

Eventually you come upon a sign to your **North** standing next to the creek. To the **West**,
a well-worn dirt path.
