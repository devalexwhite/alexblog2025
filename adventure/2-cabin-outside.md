You stand infront of a small log cabin. There's a rustic, inviting
quality to the home nestled among the trees. You see a gentle funnel of
smoke rising from the chimney, and the smell of something delicious
fills your nostrils. to the **North**, a step leads to the small patio
of the cabin. Two rocking chairs adorn the front door. To the **West** a
tire swings gently in the wind, tethered to a tree by an old, frayed
rope. A dirt path leads out to the **East**.

Where do you go?
