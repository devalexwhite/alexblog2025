You enter the small building, the door had been left open. You walk into the center of the room, and find a table in each direction. On each table, is a computer.

To the **West**, an Apple Color Classic with the Github logo displayed on the screen.

To the **North**, a transparent blue iMac with an email application open.

To the **East**, an Atari 400 connected to a CRT television. A cassette sits on the desk beside it. A note reads "my first BASIC games".
