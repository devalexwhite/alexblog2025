Yeah, big web has gone to crap, but it's amazing how alive and vibrant small web is. I frequently read great posts from interesting people across
blogs, gemini, gopher, pubnix systems and the ferdiverse. And the best part is, you can typically assume no LLMs were involved in writing found on the 
small web.
