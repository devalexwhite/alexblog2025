Stayed up too late last night throwing togther a "interactive fiction"/adventure style game on my website (it's live on the homepage!). 
It's simple, but I had a lot of fun with it. Reminded me of the maze text-adventures I used to make as a kid with Hotpaw BASIC on my Palm Pilot.
I'd spend hours drawing each room on paper, then coding it into a massive multi dimensional array.
